After working at PwC for 2 and 1/2 years, I decided to change things up and learn how to code. So, I applied and was accepted into Fullstack Academy and learned the fundamentals of web development. I then accepted a job from Cogo Labs, a tech incubator, as a web engineer. There, I've further refined my front-end skills with a focus on React.\n                </p>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          );\n        }}\n      </Motion>\n    );\n  }\n\n  scrollHandler = (scrollPos) => {\n    if (__CLIENT__) {\n      const windowStart = Math.floor(window.scrollY);\n      const scrollMove = Math.floor(scrollPos);\n      if (scrollMove > windowStart && windowStart < this.state.scrollTo) {\n        window.scrollTo(0, scrollMove);\n      }\n    }\n  };\n\n}\n\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** ./src/views/home.js\n **/","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport Helmet from 'react-helmet';\n\nimport Masthead from 'components/masthead';\nimport Button from 'components/button';\n\nexport default class Home extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n\n  onResumeClick = () => {\n    this.history.pushState(null, '/resume');\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"content\">\n        <Helmet title=\"Resume\"/>\n        <div className=\"masthead__container\">\n          <Masthead className=\"masthead--resume\"/>\n          <div className=\"center-absolute text-center\">\n            <strong className=\"masthead__title block\">\n              Resume\n            </strong>\n            <a className=\"button button--transparent\" href=\"/dist/1a556a1cd058410e4f3a59d0a62fe6ac.jpg\" download=\"1a556a1cd058410e4f3a59d0a62fe6ac.jpg\">\n              Download Resume\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"resume content__subsection text-center\">\n          <div className=\"content__hr\">\n            <h2 className=\"content__title\">\n              My Skills\n            </h2>\n            <h3 className=\"content__subtitle\">\n              And alleged talents...\n            </h3>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"content__container border-bottom center\">\n            <h4 className=\"header4\">\n              Technology\n            </h4>\n            <div className=\"col-3-2 right\">\n              <div className=\"col-3 col-3--mobile left align-top\">\n                <h5 className=\"header5\">\n                  Primary\n                </h5>\n                <ul className=\"resume__list resume__list--inside\">\n                  <li>\n                    Javascript / ES6\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    Reactjs\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    Flux Architecture\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    Webpack\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    Javascript / ES6\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    Babel\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    HTML5 / CSS3\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    PostCSS\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    BEM methodology\n                  </li>\n                </ul>\n              </div>\n              <div className=\"col-3 col-3--mobile left align-top\">\n                <h5 className=\"header5\">\n                  Secondary\n                </h5>\n                <ul className=\"resume__list resume__list--inside\">\n                  <li>\n                    Angular\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    Node.js / Express\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    Grunt\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    D3.js\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    Nginx\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    Docker\n                  </li>\n                </ul>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"content__container text-left border-bottom\">\n            <h4 className=\"header4\">\n              Experience\n            </h4>\n            <div className=\"col-4-3 right align-top\">\n              <div className=\"resume__job\">\n                <h5 className=\"header5\">\n                  Web Engineer\n                </h5>\n                <p>\n                  CogoLabs, Cambridge, MA, November 2014 – Present\n                </p>\n                <ul className=\"resume__list\">\n                  <li>\n                    Led walkthroughs of major accounting cycles that required dozens of interviews with senior members throughout the client organization\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    Top-performer in PwC's annual performance review for both years at the company;
